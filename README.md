## Which programming language and version did you pick?<br />
#### Golang<br />
## Why did you pick this programming language?<br />
#### I have opened up the possiblity of being a DevOps engineer. My brother, who works IT for a technoilogy company, told me that Golang is popular amongst DevOps engineers. So, this made me interested in exploring this programming language.<br />
## How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so.<br />
#### Golang provides all of these capabilities. From my experience with JavaScript, it seems very similar in the way that it handles all of those concepts.<br />
## List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.<br />
#### For this project I used 7 libraries. I used "encoding/csv" for reading the csv file. This library gives coders the ability to read/write to files and then also check for errors. I also used "fmt" for printing (displaying to the terminal). And "strconv" that allowed me to manipulate strings. This was helpful when slicing/extracting values in strings.<br />
